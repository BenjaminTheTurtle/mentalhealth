<h3> About Us </h3>
<h4> Some of you might be wondering the purpose of this website, so we will be answering it. </h4>
<hr>

<p> Well, we have been noticing that more and more people, youths in general are facing alot of issues regarding their psychological status yet this problem doesn't get enough importance making it get underestimated. So, by creating this website, more and more users should be aware of how our mental health is affected in everyday life and also about the importance of good mental health. Additionally, we too would like more people to know about how we can help people suffering from mental issues. At first glance, most people might have bad impressions on someone that is acting involunterily because of their mental health but we should always try to think in a better perspective and see if they are okay or not by comforting them. </p>

<p> We are all glad that his website and this project turned out succesful. Hopefully, more people will know about this global issue that is mental health not just in our local commmunity but to extend it around the world. </p>

<p> Each of us have different backgrounds, but we are all united by one goal. </p>

<h3> Bound to the world, yet lost </h3>
<p> As this is our greeting, it also holds much meaning.</p>
<p> We understand ghosts as lost souls that wander Earth with a duty they must fulfill to see "The Light". Although our group's name is Wellness Spirits, we don't really know much about the outer world yet we try our best to enlighten others about global issues and how we can help combat them prior to our knowledge and what we discover. Hence we're also lost indiviuals.</p>
